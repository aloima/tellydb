## Database file | `.tellydb`
It consists of lines and a line is as follows:
`data key + 0x1D + data type + data value + 0x1E`

+ If data type is `TELLY_NULL (0x1)`, data value will be nothing and the line will consist of `data key + 0x1D + TELLY_NULL + 0x1E`.
+ If data type is `TELLY_INT (0x2)`, data value will be represented as binary. For example, data value is `0x01 + 0x00` or `0x0100` to get 256.
+ If data type is `TELLY_STR (0x3)`, data value will be a string.
+ If data type is `TELLY_BOOL (0x4)`, data value will be `0x00` or `0x01`.
